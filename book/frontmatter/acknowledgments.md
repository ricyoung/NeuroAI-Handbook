# Acknowledgments

The creation of the NeuroAI Handbook would not have been possible without the contributions and support of many individuals and organizations. We wish to express our deepest gratitude to all who have helped make this project a reality.

We thank the authors and contributors who dedicated their time and expertise to create this comprehensive resource. Their commitment to bridging neuroscience and artificial intelligence has been the foundation of this handbook.

We also acknowledge the research institutions, laboratories, and funding agencies whose support has enabled the advancement of the field of NeuroAI. Their investment in interdisciplinary research has been crucial to the progress documented in this handbook.

Finally, we extend our appreciation to the readers and students who inspire us to create educational resources that facilitate learning and discovery at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence.
