# Figure Standards for the NeuroAI Handbook

This document outlines the standardized design elements for figures in the NeuroAI Handbook to ensure consistency across chapters.

## Color Scheme

The handbook uses a consistent color scheme to help readers quickly identify concepts across figures:

| Domain | Element | Color | Hex Code | Example Use |
|--------|---------|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Neuroscience** | Brain/Neurons | Red | `#cc0000` | Brain regions, neural circuits |
| **Neuroscience** | Neural activity | Pink | `#ffcccc` | Activation patterns, spike trains |
| **AI** | Network architecture | Blue | `#0066cc` | Neural network layers, nodes |
| **AI** | Network activation | Light blue | `#ccccff` | Activation functions, feature maps |
| **Shared** | Data/Information | Purple | `#9966cc` | Information flow, mutual concepts |
| **Background** | Neutral background | Light gray | `#f9f9f9` | Figure backgrounds |
| **Emphasis** | Highlights | Gold | `#cc9900` | Key points, novel concepts |

## Typography

- **Title**: Arial, 24pt, bold, centered
- **Subtitle**: Arial, 16pt, regular, centered
- **Labels**: Arial, 14pt, bold for headings, regular for details
- **Captions**: Arial, 12pt, regular, centered or left-aligned
- **Annotations**: Arial, 12pt, regular or italic

## Figure Structure

Each figure should include:

1. **Title**: Clear, descriptive title
2. **Labels**: All components should be clearly labeled
3. **Legend**: When using multiple colors/symbols
4. **Scale bar**: When relevant
5. **Caption**: Detailed explanation with figure number reference

## File Format

- SVG format for all diagrams (scalable, editable)
- 800px width standard (can vary for special cases)
- 16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratio preferred

## Naming Convention

File naming follows the pattern: `ch{chapter_number}_{concept}_v{version}.svg`

Example: `ch03_grid_cells_v2.svg`

## Special Elements

- Use dashed lines for connections between neuroscience and AI concepts
- Use solid lines for connections within the same domain
- Use arrows to indicate directionality or information flow
- Use consistent shapes (circles for neurons, rectangles for network layers)

## Figure Directory Structure

The figures are organized by chapter in the following directories:

- **ch01-ch14**: Core chapters covering fundamentals of neuroscience and AI
- **ch15**: Ethical AI and NeuroAI Ethics
- **ch16**: Neuromorphic Computing
- **ch17**: Brain-Computer Interfaces and Human-AI Interaction
- **ch18**: Neuromorphic Computing (extended)
- **ch19**: Cognitive Neuroscience and Deep Learning 
- **ch20**: Case Studies in NeuroAI
- **ch21**: AI for Neuroscience Discovery
- **ch22**: Quantum Computing for NeuroAI
- **ch23-ch24**: Additional advanced topics

## Recent Updates

All chapter figure directories are now complete with SVG diagrams following the consistent design system. Each chapter contains at least 3 key figures illustrating the core concepts.
