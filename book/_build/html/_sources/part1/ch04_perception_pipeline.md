# Chapter 4: Perception Pipeline – Visual Cortex → CNNs

## 4.0 Chapter Goals
- Trace the visual processing pipeline from retina to higher cortical areas
- Understand receptive fields and hierarchical feature extraction
- Connect biological vision to convolutional neural networks
- Implement simple visual filters and feature detectors

## 4.1 Visual System Architecture
- From retina to LGN to V1
- Ventral vs dorsal streams ("what" vs "where")
- Hierarchical organization of visual cortex
- Feedback connections and top-down processing

## 4.2 Receptive Fields
- Simple, complex, and hypercomplex cells
- Gabor filters and orientation selectivity
- Center-surround organization
- Feature hierarchy from V1 to IT

## 4.3 CNN Parallels
- Convolutional layers as receptive fields
- Pooling operations and invariance
- Feature hierarchies in deep networks
- Visualization of CNN features

## 4.4 From Biology to Deep Learning
- Hubel & Wiesel's discoveries → Neocognitron → LeNet → AlexNet
- Biological constraints vs engineering solutions
- Normalization and gain control mechanisms
- Attention mechanisms

## 4.5 Beyond Feedforward Processing
- Recurrence in visual processing
- Predictive coding and generative models
- Integration of context and prior knowledge
- The free energy principle

## 4.6 Code Lab
- Implementing simple Gabor filters
- Building a basic convolutional layer
- Feature visualization techniques
- Transfer learning with pre-trained CNNs

## 4.7 Take-aways
- Visual processing uses hierarchical feature extraction
- CNNs formalize key principles from visual neuroscience
- Both systems balance specificity with generalization
