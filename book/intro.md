# The Neuroscience of AI

## Preface
- Why this book / how to use it
- Glossary & notation

This handbook bridges neuroscience and artificial intelligence, exploring how biological principles inspire and inform computational models. Each chapter combines theoretical foundations with practical Python implementations.

The book is organized into five parts, progressing from foundational neuroscience concepts to cutting-edge AI applications:

1. **Brains & Inspiration**: Fundamental neuroscience concepts relevant to AI
2. **Brains Meet Math & Data**: Quantitative approaches and data analysis techniques
3. **Learning Machines**: Classic and modern machine learning approaches
4. **Frontier Models**: State-of-the-art AI architectures
5. **Reflection & Futures**: Emerging trends and ethical considerations

Each chapter includes code examples, diagrams, and hands-on exercises to reinforce concepts.
