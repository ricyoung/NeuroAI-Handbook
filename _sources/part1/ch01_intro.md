# Chapter 1: Introduction to Neuroscience â†” AI

## 1.0 Chapter Goals
- Understand the historical relationship between neuroscience and AI
- Recognize key parallels between biological and artificial neural systems
- Identify areas where biology continues to inspire AI development
- Appreciate the bidirectional relationship: AI also helps us understand the brain

## 1.1 Historical Context
- Von Neumann and the early computing architecture
- The birth of cybernetics
- McCulloch & Pitts neurons
- The perceptron by Rosenblatt
- AI winters and neural network revivals

## 1.2 Levels of Analysis
- Marr's three levels: computational, algorithmic, implementational
- From neurons to networks to behavior
- Computational neuroscience approaches
- Cognitive modeling

## 1.3 Key Parallels
- Information processing units (neurons vs artificial units)
- Network architectures
- Learning mechanisms
- Representational properties

## 1.4 Case Studies
- Object recognition in visual cortex vs CNNs
- Reinforcement learning models and reward systems
- Memory systems (hippocampus) vs memory networks

## 1.5 Current Challenges
- Scale and complexity differences
- Energy efficiency gap
- Interpretability issues
- Generalization capabilities

## 1.6 Take-aways
