# Acknowledgments

The creation of the NeuroAI Handbook would not have been possible without the contributions and support of many individuals and organizations. We wish to express our deepest gratitude to all who have helped make this project a reality.

We thank the authors and contributors who dedicated their time and expertise to create this comprehensive resource. Their commitment to bridging neuroscience and artificial intelligence has been the foundation of this handbook.

We also acknowledge the research institutions, laboratories, and funding agencies whose support has enabled the advancement of NeuroAI. Their investment in interdisciplinary research has been crucial to the progress documented in this handbook.

A special thank you goes to all the educators who spent countless hours patiently guiding me and embedding knowledge into my sometimes stubborn mind. Your dedication has profoundly shaped my understanding and passion for science.

Most importantly, my heartfelt appreciation goes to my wife, Alice. Her unwavering support, patience, and encouragement have been my strength, especially during moments when my eccentricities might have made life challenging. She has always been there, holding my hand and helping me keep going. Alice, none of this would have been possible without you.

Finally, we extend our appreciation to the readers and students who inspire us to create educational resources that facilitate learning and discovery at the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence.
