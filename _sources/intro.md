# The Neuroscience of AI

## Preface
- Why this book / how to use it
- Glossary & notation

This handbook bridges neuroscience and artificial intelligence, exploring how biological principles inspire and inform computational models. Each chapter combines theoretical foundations with practical Python implementations.

The book is organized into five parts, progressing from foundational neuroscience concepts to cutting-edge AI applications:

1. **Brains & Inspiration**: Fundamental neuroscience concepts relevant to AI
2. **Brains Meet Math & Data**: Quantitative approaches and data analysis techniques
3. **Learning Machines**: Classic and modern machine learning approaches
4. **Frontier Models**: State-of-the-art AI architectures
5. **Reflection & Futures**: Emerging trends and ethical considerations

Each chapter includes code examples, diagrams, and hands-on exercises to reinforce concepts.

### Recent Updates

We have recently expanded our coverage of modern AI architectures with detailed implementations:

- **Deep Learning Fundamentals**: Neural networks, backpropagation, optimization techniques, and regularization methods with PyTorch implementations
- **Sequence Processing Models**: RNNs, attention mechanisms, and transformer architectures, with biological parallels and practical code examples
- **Large Language Models**: Comprehensive overview of LLM architectures, fine-tuning approaches (including parameter-efficient methods like LoRA), prompting techniques, and connections to neural language processing

Each of these chapters includes practical code labs to help readers implement and experiment with these technologies.
